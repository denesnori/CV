# Nora Denes - CV
#### Junior full-stack JavaScript developer

### Summary
I am full-stack developer living in London. My background is in Chemistry. Over time, my interest slowly shifted towards Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, and in the end to programming. I have recently graduated from [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/), a highly-selective free, peer-lead 16 week long coding bootcamp.

I am currently seeking for a permanent role with opportunities for growth and learning. I am
a hard-working, enthusiastic individual with excellent team working skills.
I am an avid learner, I enjoy that every day there is something new and exciting to play around with.

I sample of projects that I  worked on can be found on  [ my portfolio webiste](https://denesnori.github.io/portfolio-website/).
